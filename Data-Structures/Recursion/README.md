Ah, recursion. 
The most exciting part of recursion, in my personal opinion, is that is is exactly like Christopher Nolan's inception - brilliant and requires a base case to be solved.

These are the resources I'm using to teach myself recursion! 

1. Understand Euclid's Algorithm: Greatest Common Divisor (just read the start in: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/12su/lectures/23recursion.pdf )
2. Then solve this leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-greatest-common-divisor-of-array/submissions/ and ponder on the inefficient time complexity of this particular recursive solution
3. Try to figure out the time complexity of euclid's algorithm using https://www.baeldung.com/cs/euclid-time-complexity

4. Understand recursion in Factorials (the start of a different pdf: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis110/16sp/lectures/23recursion.pdf)

5. Understand the Towers of Hanoi

6. Understand recursion in the Fibonacci Numbers
7. Complete the Penn CS110 homework Exercises (https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis110/current/homework/sierpinski.html)
