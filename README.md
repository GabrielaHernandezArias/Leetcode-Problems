# Leetcode-Problems

Hi! Here I am documenting my solutions to many leetcode problems, and adding a bit of analysis and fun commentary on each of them. I started out mostly implementing data structures and have branched out to learning about different algorithms.

Currently, I am practicing recursion, and on my to-do list are sorting and searching algorithms! :)
